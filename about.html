        <h2>When I Hear "Accessibility"</h2>
        <p>
          When I hear Accessibility in general terms, I like to think of including everyone, whether they are disabled
          or not. The reason for this is because I feel that everyone should have the same experience when doing anything
          in the world reguard of the physical or mental ability. But when we talk about accessibility on the web specifically,
          I still think about the same general things, like full inclusion. However, one the big things that I think needs to
          happen when talking about web accessibility is that there needs to accessibility checks through the whole desgin of
          the website so that you make sure that you are in fact creating a site that is fully accessible to everyone no matter
          what their disability might be.
        </p>
        <h2>Automated Tools are NOT Enough</h2>
        <p>
          When going through the accessibility process, there are a lot of automated tools that you can use to check the
          accessibility of your website, and while these are good to use for general checking, they are not something that
          you should fully rely on. The reason for this is because, it's an automated tool so that means that it's just a
          program that is looking for certain things. I personally think that these are good to use for inital checks to
          make sure that there's nothing that is really bad or really obvious taht is missing, but if you want to really
          make sure that you have a fully accessible site, you need to bring in actual disabled users to test your site,
          so that you can see possible issues that the automated tools might not have caught.
        </p>
        <h3>Accessibility Standards I Use</h3>
        <dl>
          <dt>WCAG 2.0</dt>
          <dd>
            The biggest one that I use is WCAG and I make sure to always hit at least the AA standard, but I will also 
            always to my best to shoot for AAA as well because going over the standard will only create a better user 
            experience.
          </dd>
          <dt>Designing with the User in Mind</dt>
          <dd>
            I always design my sites now with the user in mind becaus user experience is also something that I use in my
            design process which will help the accessibility even more because I will be putting myself in the mindset of
            the user as well as looking at accessibility.
          </dd>
          <dt>WAVE</dt>
          <dd>
            WAVE is an automated accessibility tool that I like to use for a general check on things to make sure that I don't
            have any errors or anything that is so bad in terms of accessibility that it is caught by this tool. For this I mainly
            am looking for my WCAG AA checks to make sure that I at least meet the minimum standard for accessibility. 
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <h3>Why Inclusion During Design Matters</h3>
        <p>
          Inclusion during the design process is extremely important, and this means during the entire process from start to finish.
          The reason for this is so that you can identify errors early on in the process when changes are a lot easier and cheaper to
          fix, rather than having made a whole finished product that then ultimately does not work and that has to be remade which then
          in turn means spending unessecary money when most of the issues could have been fixed early on when you hadn't already put in
          a ton of time and money creating. When talking about inclusion during the design, this also means that you aren't just testing
          disabled users, but that you are also testing abled users, so that you know that your site works for absolutely everyone.

        <h2>My Accessibility Statement</h2>
          <h3>Conformance status</h3>
          <p>
            The <a class="statement-link" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA.
            <span>Matt Fitzgerald's Accessible Website</span>
            is
            <span data-printfilter="lowercase">partially conformant</span>
            with

            <span>
            <span>Partially conformant</span>
            means that
            <span>some parts of the content do not fully conform to the accessibility standard</span>.
